      <h1 id="about">About Myself</h1>
      <p>
        I go by "Average Helper" online, partly because my name is super generic. Average, really.
        I've been a programmer for about 12 years. I try to be helpful where I can, especially to
        write respectful software.
      </p>
      <p>
        This portfolio is real basic, made to quickly point to my other projects and experience. It
        isn't much to look at, but it is mine.

        Here's just a few things I worked on myself that I'm proud of. You can
        <a href="https://github.com/AverageHelper" target="_blank">check my GitHub</a> for more:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/AverageHelper/Gamgee" target="_blank">Gamgee</a> &ndash; A fun
          little Discord bot to help manage a music queue for public DJ events. Written in
          <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a>.

        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/AverageHelper/meta-comments" target="_blank">meta-comments</a>
          &ndash; The first VS Code plugin I ever published! It decorates code based on
          specially-formatted comments.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://github.com/AverageHelper/ItemEncryptor" target="_blank">ItemEncryptor</a>
          &ndash; A <a href="https://www.swift.org" target="_blank">Swift</a> package to make data
          encryption easy. I use this in some of my smaller projects to facilitate end-to-end
          encryption of sensitive data.
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://recorded.finance" target="_blank">Recorded Finance</a>

            >end-to-end encrypted</a
          >
          finance app for keeping track of account balances. I had a version of this written for iOS
          in Swift, but I've began to port that project to the web for better cross-platform
          compatibility and accessibility. The project is still in its infant stages, with several
          front-end glitches I want to fix before I "release" the project into the wild. The
          front-end is written in
          <a href="https://svelte.dev" target="_blank">Svelte</a>, with
          <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org" target="_blank">TypeScript</a> on the front- and
          back-end.
