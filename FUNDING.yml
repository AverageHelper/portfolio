# Thanks for being here!

# I write software for fun. If that software makes someone's life easier along the way, all the better! ‚ù§Ô∏è I started writing software in 2014, began working on open source in 2016, and finally figured git out in 2018. Nearly all of the software I use in my day-to-day life is open source. I hope to work full time on open source software one day, but my employer right now is entirely closed-source, servers aren't free, and devs need to eat. Until I can make a living on FOSS, my time and ability to contribute to other projects are very limited.

# While my part-time job pays the bills with a little room for fun, donations will let me spend more time contributing to projects I care about, and projects of my own that I think might be useful.

# ## What I am working on

# - [Recorded Finance](https://recorded.finance), an end-to-end encrypted finance application
# - [Gamgee](https://github.com/AverageHelper/Gamgee), a simple DJ assistant for Discord
# - Lots of small projects for me to learn on, contributing to community work as I find time

# ## What your funding will do

# - Cover server hosting costs (for [Recorded Finance](https://recorded.finance) especially)
# - Help cover living expenses
# - Help me support other FOSS projects

# As always, I'm always happy to receive contributions to my open-source projects. Issues and PRs always welcome! üòä

# If you want to support my employer's projects [Inventory Shield](https://inventoryshield.com) or [Referral Reactor](https://referralreactor.com), go give them a looksee on their own websites. I don't own those projects, so donations here wouldn't go to them.
