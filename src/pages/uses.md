## Software

### Desktop

- **OS:** MacOS - I'm pretty much stuck on this for my main hardware until I either migrate onto another system or [Asahi Linux](https://asahilinux.org) gets stable.
- **OS:** [Fedora Silverblue](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/silverblue/) - Like Fedora, but... silver? Idk, I like having a read-only system partition. I use this for my secondary machine. Might try NixOS later, idk.
- **Notes:** [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) - Portable notes files in Markdown!
- **Email:** [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net) - Widely-available FOSS email client that works just as well as Apple's default one.
- **Browser:** [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/download/thanks/) - I [harden](https://web.archive.org/web/20221013104259/https://chrisx.xyz/blog/yet-another-firefox-hardening-guide/) mine. Better than Chr\*me, don't @ me
- **Epub reader:** [Thorium Reader](https://thorium.edrlab.org) - Trying this one out as a FOSS alternative to Apple's default offering. <!-- TODO: Try https://github.com/johnfactotum/foliate on Linux, and maybe try building for macOS? -->

### Mobile

- **OS:** [CalyxOS](https://calyxos.org) - I'd recommend [GrapheneOS](https://grapheneos.org) instead if you need Google Play at all.
- **Reminders:** [Tasks.org](https://tasks.org), synced via [EteSync](https://www.etesync.com)
- **Weather:** [Breezy Weather](https://github.com/breezy-weather/breezy-weather)

### Self-host

- **Git forge:** [Forgejo](https://forgejo.org) ([instance](https://git.average.name))
- **VPS:** [Linode](https://www.linode.com) - Hosts this site, and other projects.
- **Misc:** [NextCloud](https://nextcloud.com) - I actually don't use this much yet. Need to find a better storage solution than the one I use now.

### Services

- [**EteSync**](https://www.etesync.com) - I keep my contacts and reminders synced this way.
- [**Proton**](https://proton.me) - Email, Calendar, Drive, VPN, all open-source and well audited.
- [**SimpleLogin**](https://simplelogin.io) - I make email aliases for every account of mine. That way, when I start getting spam, I can tell from the `to:` field who sold me out :3
- [**pgs.sh**](https://pgs.sh) - Static site hosting, managed with SSH! (Seriously way cool!)
- [**Cloudflare**](https://www.cloudflare.com) - DNS, hosting for some projects (for now)
- [**Libro.fm**](https://libro.fm): DRM-free audiobooks. I use this instead of Audible.
- [**Qobuz**](https://www.qobuz.com): DRM-free music. I use this instead of iTunes wherever possible. (FLAC for the win!)

## Hardware

- MacBook Pro 13-inch 2020
- [Framework](https://frame.work) 13"
- Google Pixel 4a

## Stationery

- [**Gallery Leather Desk Journal**](https://www.galleryleather.com/desk-leather-journal) - The best paperfeel I've ever seen. I don't have much experience, but of the three or four journals I've tried, these ones are the best.
- [**Precise V5 RT, 0.5mm**](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Precise-V5-RT-Retractable-Rollerball-Pen-0.5-mm-Black-Pack-of-2/pd/17976) - The best ink pens I've ever used. Again, I'm not experienced, but from what I have tried, ink pens beat ballpoint in terms of consistent inkage on paper, and these pens are a good combination:
  - inexpensive, and sold pretty much everywhere,
  - easy to change ink as needed, assuming [cartridges](https://www.jetpens.com/Pilot-Precise-V5-RT-Rollerball-Pen-Refill-0.5-mm-Black-Pack-of-2/pd/2341) are available,
  - won't leak on an airplane (probably),
  - and feels great to write with.
