# Support and Funding

Thanks for being here!

I write software for fun! ❤️ I hope to work full time on open source software one day, but servers aren't free and devs need to eat. Until I can make a living on FOSS, my time and ability to contribute to other projects are very limited. Your donation will help with:

- Project hosting costs (domains and servers)
- Living expenses (I love pizza)
- Time to contribute to other projects I care about

You can support me on [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/avg). Eventually I'll add more options, such as [Ko-fi](https://ko-fi.com/avghelper).

I'm always happy to receive direct contributions to my open-source projects in the form of issues and PRs!
