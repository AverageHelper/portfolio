# Average Helper

I'm just a regular average developer girl, doing regular average codethings since 2011. I try to be helpful where I can.

## Stuff I do for fun

Here's a few things I built myself that I'm proud of:

[**Gamgee**](https://github.com/AverageHelper/Gamgee) - A fun little Discord bot to help manage a music queue for public DJ events. Written in TypeScript. (Currently working on moving the source to [Forgejo](https://git.average.name/AverageHelper?tab=repositories).)

[**flashcards**](https://flashcards.average.name) - A simple flashcards site. Uses zero Javascript to present card decks! (Very much work-in-progress.)

[**ItemEncryptor**](https://github.com/AverageHelper/ItemEncryptor) - A Swift package to make data encryption easy. I use this in some of my smaller projects to facilitate end-to-end encryption of sensitive data. (Basically done, might need updating for Swift 6.)

[**Recorded Finance**](https://recorded.finance) - An end-to-end encrypted finance app for keeping track of account balances. The front-end is written in Svelte, with TypeScript on the front- and back-end. (Work-in progress, rewriting back-end for easier self-hosting.)

[**This website**](https://git.average.name/AverageHelper/portfolio) - All HTML, CSS, and Markdown, rolled together statically using Astro. (Always a work in progress, lol.)

And lots more on [my git forge](https://git.average.name/AverageHelper?tab=repositories).

## Stuff I get paid for

[I freelance](/work) in my spare time.

[My first and biggest client so far](https://github.com/Inventory-Shield/) have only closed-source code, unfortunately, but I have contributed to open-source projects on their behalf.
