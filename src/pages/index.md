# Average Helper

I'm just a regular average developer girl, doing regular average codethings since 2011. I try to be helpful where I can.

## Stuff I do for fun

Here's a few things I built myself that I'm proud of:

[**Gamgee**](https://github.com/AverageHelper/Gamgee) - A fun little Discord bot to help manage a music queue for public DJ events. Written in TypeScript.

[**flashcards**](https://flashcards.average.name) - A simple flashcards site. Uses zero Javascript to present card decks!

[**ItemEncryptor**](https://github.com/AverageHelper/ItemEncryptor) - A Swift package to make data encryption easy. I use this in some of my smaller projects to facilitate end-to-end encryption of sensitive data.

[**Recorded Finance**](https://recorded.finance) - An end-to-end encrypted finance app for keeping track of account balances. The front-end is written in Svelte, with TypeScript on the front- and back-end.

And more on [my git forge](https://git.average.name/AverageHelper?tab=repositories).

## Stuff I get paid for

I first learned Typescript, Vue, and Node since starting at [Inventory Shield, LLC](https://inventoryshield.com) in 2018. Their products are web apps, with Apache Cordova&trade; to wrap them into iOS and Android app shells for native device features. Unfortunately, the source code not available to read, but you can check out their products instead:

[**Inventory Shield**](https://inventoryshield.com) - An inventory management solution for businesses.

[**Referral Reactor**](https://referralreactor.com) - A referral management platform. Anyone can use Referral Reactor for free, and get monetary bonuses for sending referrals to participating businesses.
