			"refAlt": "A full-body portrait of an adult pegasus pony mare standing tall with her wings unfurled. Her long golden mane flows down her shoulder, reaching a little past her chest. Her slightly curly tail almost reaches the ground. In another pose, the pegasus wears black-rimmed half-moon glasses. She smiles warmly at the camera. A picture on her rear shows a stylized compass rose, whose exact design is usually left up to the artist. This one is composed of a red and tan background, with an eight-pointed black-and-white star extending from the center to the edge, and the letters N, E, S, and W visible along the outside. A transgender flag is clearly visible on the ref.",
