# This one doesn't support robots.txt: https://www.allenai.org/crawler
# block it with your reverse-proxy or WAF or something.

# I'm not blocking CCBot for now. It publishes a free index for anyone to use.
# Googe used this to train the initial version of Bard (now called Gemini).
# I allow CCBot since its index is also used for upstart/hobbyist search engines
# like Alexandria and for genuinely useful academic work I personally like.
# I allow Owler for similar reasons:
# <https://openwebsearch.eu/owler/#owler-opt-out>
# <https://openwebsearch.eu/common-goals-with-common-crawl/>.
# Omgilibot/Omgili is similar to CCBot, except it sells the scrape results.
# I'm not familiar enough with Omgili to make a call here.
# In the long run, my embedded robots meta-tags and headers could cover gen-AI

# I don't block cohere-ai or Perplexitybot: they don't appear to actually
# scrape data for LLM training purposes. The crawling powers search engines
# with integrated pre-trained LLMs.
# TODO: investigate whether YouBot scrapes to train its own in-house LLM.
